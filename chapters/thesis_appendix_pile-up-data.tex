	\caption{Cumulative fraction of neutrinos versus misidentified energy fraction for a simple \Pgpz-induced EM shower reconstruction algorithm based on a cone-cylinder union.
		All energy deposited inside the cone-cylinder union by descendants of parent neutrinos different from the parent of the corresponding \Pgpz photon is counted as misidentified.
		Colour indicates different selections of misidentified energy: total (cyan); excluding depositions from muons (red); deposition from photons, neutrons, and their descendants only (blue).
		The curve depicts the fraction of neutrinos on the y-axis with a misidentified energy fraction equal to or lower than the corresponding value on the x-axis.
		The simulated beam intensity is \SI{10}{\mega\watt} at \SI{80}{\giga\electronvolt} proton energy.}
