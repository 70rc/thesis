\chapter{The \AC\ approach\label{chap:argoncube}}
To mitigate the drawbacks mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:lartpc_challenges}, the Bern group has founded the \AC\ collaboration, with the goal of developing a new fully-modular type of LArTPC.
Modularity reduces pile-up and allows for shorter drift-times, thus slackens the requirements on argon purity and HV.
A modular detector also contains light within each module, allowing for a more accurate trigger system.
Maintenance and upgrading of a modular detector is much easier than for a monolothic one.
