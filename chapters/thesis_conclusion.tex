\chapter{Conclusion\label{chap:conclusion}}
The sum of this work demonstrates all the prerequisites for building the first ArgonCube module prototypes.
Several high impact papers have resulted, and will continue to result from these studies.
The pixel readout implemented and characterised is the first of its kind in LAr, and can potentially abolish a major limitation to TPC design.
The TPC used for the pixel studies also demonstrates a novel light readout utilising SiPMs and WLS fibres in a LArTPC for the first time.
The 3D reconstruction we implement into LArSoft is the first truly 3D reconstruction ever used for LAr experiments.
Its implementation in LArSoft makes the technology more accessible for design studies of future experiments.
