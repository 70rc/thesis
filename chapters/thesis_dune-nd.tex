\chapter{Research and Development for the DUNE Near Detector\label{chap:rd-dune-nd}}

Besides mechanics, cryogenics and high voltage system, the charge and light readout proposed for the ArgonCube DUNE near detector need to be tested and designed.
For this purpose, a new prototype TPC was designed from scratch.
Using this setup, a fully pixelated charge readout and a light readout employing SiPMs were tested recording cosmic muons and Compton electrons from a \si{Co ^ {60}} source.


\section{Simulation\label{sec:rd-dune-nd_simulation}}

Establishing a simulation of the pixelated readout assists its design and implementation in future detectors, which will be especially important for the physics requirements of those detectors.
An important outcome is the influence of the module walls on reconstruction efficiencies.
They can be regarded as missing pixels in the simulation.
My task is to implement the actual pixel readout into existing simulations of future detectors in the beginning of 2017.
