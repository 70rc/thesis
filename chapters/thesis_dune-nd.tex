\chapter{Feasibility Study of a Pixelated LArTPC for the \dune Near Detector}
\label{chap:dune-nd}

With \AC\ selected as  the \lar\ component of the \dune\ near detector (ND), there were two main question that needed to be addressed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is a pixelated \lartpc\ feasible?
	\item Can the \lar\ detector handle the high rates?
\end{enumerate}
Number one is addressed in Chapter~\ref{chap:viper}.
This chapter will address question number two.


\section{The High-Multiplicity Environment of the \dune\ Near Detector}
\label{sec:dune-nd_multiplicity}

One of the main goals of \dune\ is to measure the Dirac CP violation phase $\delta_{\m{CP}}$ provided it has a non-degenerate value.
To reach a $3 \sigma$ sensitivity for a \SI{75}{\percent} coverage of the $\delta_{\m{CP}}$ parameter space, an exposure of \SI{1320}{\kilo\tonne\mega\watt years} is required (see Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_cpv-sens}).~\cite{dune2}
Assuming the reference design of a \SI{40}{\kilo\tonne} far detector and a \SI{1}{\mega\watt} beam results in a data taking time of \SI{33}{years}.
Therefore, to make the data taking time shorter, a beam $> \SI{1}{\mega\watt}$ is required.
On the other hand, combining the numbers of the reference design in~\cite{dune2}, the event rate in the ND amounts to \SI{0.1}{events\per\tonne\per\mega\watt} leading to significant event pile-up.
This number does not include rock events---secondary particles produced by beam neutrino interactions in the surrounding material, entering the detector.
The neutrino beam flux is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_flux}.

\section{The Argon Box Simulation Tool}
\label{sec:dune-nd_argon-box}

Argon Box\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dadwyer/argon_box}} was developed with the goal of providing an easy-to-use simulation of particle interactions in \lar\ component of the ND.
At the time of this writing its feature set is quite limited, in particular it does not incorporate any other detector materials except for the box of argon.
Primary particles can either be provided by a particle gun (e.g.\ $e^-$, $n$, $p$, $\mu^+$) or in form of a \emph{HEPEVT} file---a file format standard for passage of particle events between different simulation tools.
For this study, several million neutrino events were produced with the GENIE\footnote{\url{https://genie.hepforge.org}} neutrino event generator.
Secondary particle transport and interaction in Argon Box is performed by Geant4.\footnote{\url{http://geant4.cern.ch}}
Finally, the energy deposition in \lar\ is voxelised and stored together with all the necessary ancillary information about the depositing particle.
The data is stored in the tree format of the ROOT data analysis framework.\footnote{\url{https://root.cern}}
This allows for convenient further processing using ROOT.


\section{$\pi^0$ pile-up study}
\label{sec:dune-nd_pi0}

A significant amount of $\pi^0$ are produced in several resonant and coherent neutrino interactions (see Section~\ref{sec:nu-detection_interactions} and~\cite{dune2}).
They decay according to
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
	\pi^0 & \qraq & \gamma + \gamma
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
with a branching ratio of \SI{98.8}{\percent}\cite{pdg}.
The photons subsequently produce electromagnetic showers in \lar\ (see Section~\ref{sec:nu-detection_fs}).
At the energies of the \dune\ beam (see Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_flux}), most showers do not deposit a homogenous cone of charge but rather a lot of individually resolvable $e^{\pm}$ tracks.
More importantly, there often are significatn gaps in betweend these charge clusters.
A main challenge of shower reconstruction is to associate these well separated charge blobs to the correct event.
Misidentiions lead to a misreconstruction of the neutrino energy.
The resulting discrepancy to the true neutrino energy has the potential to skew the measured energy spectrum and, thus, influence the oscillation measurements.
The complexity of reconstruction paired with the potential impact on the physics measurements makes photons produced by $\pi^0$ decays a good sample to study the robustness to pile-up of a pixelated \lartpc\ in the \dune\ ND environment.
