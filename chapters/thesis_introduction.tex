The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven to be remarkably precise in its predictions over the last decades.
However, there are still some missing pieces.
One of them is the intriguing nature of neutrinos.
Not only do their mass eigenstates mix with their flavour eigenstates but also are their masses smaller than the charged leptons by several orders of magnitude.
Measuring these effects is not simplified by the fact that the interaction rates (cross-section) of neutrinos are extremely small, raising the need for high intensity sources along with extremely massive detectors.
This is the reason why it took almost \num{25} years from their proposition to the first measurement of neutrinos.
As of today, neutrino mixing is well-understood and their masses have been proven to be non-zero.
The basis for this was the discovery of neutrino oscillations, a consequence of neutrino flavour mixing paired with non-zero masses.
However, there are still several unknowns in today's neutrino mixing and oscillation model.
In particular, the model contains three CP-violating phases that have yet to be measured.
The consequences of measuring CP-violation in neutrino oscillation could be far-reaching.
Via certain cosmological models, it could explain the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe.
Besides, while it is certain that at least two out of the three neutrinos have non-zero masses, their ordering is still unknown.
Its determination will help to integrate neutrino massive neutrinos into the SM where they are massless as of today.

Measuring the unknown parameters of the neutrino mixing and oscillation model will required a neutrino interaction sample of unprecedented size.
Much of today's knowledge was gained from neutrinos produced in the sun and the Earth's atmosphere.
However, for future experiments, these and other natural sources are not intense and/or precise enough for the required measurements.
Therefore, artificially produced neutrino beams will be employed, paired with huge detectors.
Not only are neutrino interactions with matter very rare they are also quite manifold, giving raise to the need for detectors capable of recording complex event topologies.

Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (\lartpc{}s) are a prime candidate for the aforementioned requirements.
They combine a high-density target material with a high-precision 3D detector.
The incoming neutrinos interact with the \lar{}, producing charged secondary particles which in turn ionise \ce{Ar} atoms.
By means of an electric field, the produced electron-ion pairs can be separated and drifted towards a two-dimensional charge readout.
A small remainder of pairs recombine and produce a very prompt (\si{\nano\second}) UV light flash.
It can used to determine the propagation time of the charge towards the readout plane.
Because charge drift in a medium subject to an electric field occurs at constant velocity, the distance from the ionisation location to the readout plane can be determined.
Combined with the 2D information from the readout, the full 3D interaction topology can be reconstructed.

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (\dune{}) is a next generation long-baseline beam neutrino oscillation experiment putting a \lartpc{} in an accelerator-produced muon neutrino beam.
Neutrino oscillations will be observed over a baseline of \SI{1300}{\kilo\metre}.
Several implications result from the required number of neutrino interactions to be sensitive to CP violation and neutrino mass ordering.
As mentioned above, a very intense neutrino beam and a large target mass are necessary.
However, this is not enough; at the same time, uncertainties have to be kept low.
Statistical uncertainties can be lowered by acquiring more neutrino interactions but this is not true for systematic uncertainties which therefore will become the limiting factor at some point.
They have various sources, some of which can be exploited to lower the systematic uncertainties.
Two of the biggest contributors are the neutrino beam and the interaction model of neutrinos with matter.
Beam-related uncertainties can be eliminated partially by characterising the neutrino beam at the production location.
A \emph{near detector} will be placed in front of the beam facility in addition to the \emph{far detector} at the end of the baseline.
Many uncertainties cancel out by comparing the neutrino fluxes in the near and far detector.
Uncertainties related to the interaction model cancel out as well if the same target material is used in both detectors.
Finally, using the same technology in both detectors, cancels even more or the remaining uncertainties.
Therefore, the near detector needs to contain a \lartpc{} as well.

Due to technological limitations, \lartpc{} charge readout s have been realised by means of multiple one dimensional wire planes---the last of them collecting the charge while the previous ones record the induced voltage pulse by the passing charge.
Combined with the time of the drifting charge, this results in one 2D image of the event topology per wire plane, effectively reducing the 3D capabilities of the TPC two multiple 2D projections.
Additionally, \lartpc{}s are comparatively slow detectors.
The drift time of charge in \lar{} is $\order{\SI{1}{\milli\metre\per\micro\second}}$, resulting in readout times of several \si{milli\second} for large detectors.
Both the above have not prevented the huge success of this detector up to now.
Due to the low interaction cross-section, event rates in these detectors have been low enough to cope with given the above limitations.
While this might still apply to the \dune{} far detector, this is certainly not true for the near detector.
Even though, neutrino interaction rates are extremely low, combined with the high-intensity neutrino beam of \dune{}, the event rates in the near detector will be significantly higher than what contemporary \lartpc{}s have coped with.



\todo[inline, color=red]{introduction}
To measure the remaining unknown parameters of the PMNS matrix and the mass hierarchy in neutrino oscillation physics, detectors with masses of orders of magnitude larger than so far are needed.
There are two obvious demonstrated choices.
Water Cherenkov detectors provide a large cost-efficient target mass which makes them interesting for proton decay searches as well.
A \lartpc{} on the other hand is an imaging detector providing precise tracking, while simultaneously acting as a homogeneous calorimeter with a precise measurement of energy deposited.
Furthermore, the 3D resolution of these detectors allows for an efficient \Pepm-\Pgg separation, thus reducing the \Pgpz background in \Pgne identification.

For a TPC to work, the detection medium needs to have a low electronegativity.
Noble gases are an obvious choice for this.
To provide a high target mass, they are liquified.
The ideal choice would be LXe which therefore is used for low volume experiments such as neutrino-less double beta decay and dark matter searches.
The drawback of xenon is that it is expensive and rare.
Besides, \lar{} has a longer radiation length than LXe and produces a comparable number of photons per \si{\mega\electronvolt}, it is also abundant and relatively cheap.

Future neutrino oscillation physics experiments aim to measure the \dcp phase and determine the neutrino mass hierarchy.
With the recent measurement of the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle, new experiments can be tuned to the right parameter space to be most sensitive in the most probable regions.
Both measurements require much higher statistics than contemporary experiments have achieved.
In turn, higher statistics require that the neutrino flux is increased, and an increase in detection efficiencies.
Efficiency is improved by increasing the size of the detector by up to two orders of magnitude in comparison to the current generation, the increase in size also improves event containment.

These imposed requirements lead to several new challenges for the detector design.
Higher flux beams put higher demands on the precision of the trigger system to reach reasonable trigger efficiencies and purities.
Additionally, \lartpc{}s have some intrinsic issues in high-flux particle beams, most of these issues stem from the detector volume required for the containment of events:
The long drift-times lead to event pile-up and also require higher voltages and higher purity argon, and unconfined scintillation light makes it harder to use a light detection system as a coincidence trigger.
Event pile-up is worsened still by the intrinsic reconstruction ambiguities of the conventional wire readout.
The complexity of event reconstruction due to the projective nature of wires further reduces the ability of the trigger system.
As well as being notoriously fragile, wire readouts and their associated framework are a major limiting factor in detector design.
The most inhibitive drawback to monolithic detectors is the down-time cost involved in repair or upgrade work.
Independent of future neutrino experiments, the solution of all those problems will lead to next generation \lartpc{}s bringing huge improvements for all future applications of such detectors.
