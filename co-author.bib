ABSTRACT = {ArgonCube Light readout system (ArCLight) is a novel device for detecting scintillation light over large areas with Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) of the order of a few percent.
  Its robust technological design allows for efficient use in large-volume particle detectors, such as Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) or liquid scintillator detectors.
  Due to its dielectric structure it can be placed inside volumes with high electric field.
  It could potentially replace vacuum PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMTs) in applications where high PDE is not required.
  The photon detection efficiency for a 10 × 10 cm2 detector prototype was measured to be in the range of 0.8 percent to 2.2 percent across the active area.},

ABSTRACT = {The Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program aims to observe and reconstruct thousands of neutrino-argon interactions with its three detectors (SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS-T600), using their hundred-ton scale Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers to perform a rich physics analysis program, in particular focused on the search for sterile neutrinos.
  Given the relatively shallow depth of the detectors, the continuous flux of cosmic ray particles crossing their volumes introduces a constant background which can be falsely identified as part of the event of interest.
  Here we present the Cosmic Ray Tagger (CRT) system, a novel technique to tag and identify these crossing particles using scintillation modules which measure their time and coordinates relative to the internal events to the neutrino detector, with the intent of mitigating their effect in the event tracking reconstruction.},

  abstract={We describe a novel high-speed front-end electronic board (FEB) for interfacing an array of 32 Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPM) with a computer.
    The FEB provides individually adjustable bias for the SiPMs, and performs low-noise analog signal amplification, conditioning and digitization.
    It provides event timing information accurate to 1.3 ns RMS.
    The signal-to-noise ratio of 12 is attained for the first photo-electron peak.
    The back-end data interface is realized on the basis of 100 Mbps Ethernet.
    The design allows daisy-chaining of up to 256 units into one network interface, thus enabling compact and efficient readout schemes for multi-channel scintillating detectors, using SiPMs as photo-sensors.}
