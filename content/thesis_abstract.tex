The \gls{sm} of particle physics has proven to be remarkably precise in its predictions however there are still some missing pieces like the intriguing nature of neutrinos.
Particularly neutrino flavour eigenstates not coincide with their mass eigenstates; the flavour eigenstates are a mixture of the mass eigenstates resulting in oscillation for non-zero neutrino masses.
Neutrino mixing and oscillations have been extensively studied during the last few decades probing the parameters of the three flavour model.
Nevertheless, several unanswered questions remain: the possible existence of a \gls{cp} violating phase in the mixing matrix and the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates.
The next-generation \dune{} is being built to answer these questions via a detailed study of long-baseline neutrino oscillations.
Like any oscillation experiment, \dune{} requires two detectors: one near the source to characterise the unoscillated beam, and one far away to measure the oscillated beam.
Achieving sensitivity to \gls{cp} violation and mass ordering will require a data sample of unprecedented size and precision.
Therefore, a high-intensity beam (\SI{2}{\mega\watt}) and massive detectors (\SI{40}{\kilo\tonne} at the far site) providing excellent tracking and calorimetry are required.
\glspl{lartpc} fulfil these requirements excellently and were therefore chosen as \glspl{fd}.
To bring systematic uncertainties down to the required level of a few percent, a \lartpc{} component in the \gls{nd} complex is also necessary.
The high-rate \gls{nd} environment poses significant challenges to traditional \lartpc{} designs:
Their wire charge readout reduces the excellent \gls{3d} tracking capabilities of a \lartpc{} to a number of \gls{2d} projections.
Furthermore, \lartpc{}s are comparatively slow detectors due to the finite charge drift velocity ($\sim \SI{1}{\milli\metre\per\micro\second}$).
To overcome limitations a pixelated charge readout for \lartpc{}s was developed and successfully tested in the framework of this thesis.
This was the first time such a pixels were deployed in a single-phase \lartpc{}, and  represent the single largest advancement in the sensitivity of \lartpc{}s---enabling true \gls{3d} tracking.
The development and characterization of the pixels is described, along with a software framework that was established to reconstruct recorded cosmic muon tracks employing a Kalman filter.
The pixel demonstrator \gls{tpc} also featured a novel cold \gls{sipm}-based light collection system, which lead to the development of the \AL system, the characterisation of which is also described.
The large volumes required by the \dune{} \lartpc{}s result in longer drift distances and thus require higher drift voltages than contemporary detectors.
World leading studies of \gls{hv} breakdowns in LAr including high-speed footage, current-voltage characteristics, and optical spectrometry are presented. 
A breakdown-mitigation method was developed which allowed \lartpc{}s to operate at electric fields an order of magnitude higher than previously achieved.
To guarantee a safe and prolonged operation it was found that it is more effective to keep fields below \SI{40}{\kilo\volt\per\centi\metre} at all points in the detector.
The comprehensive conclusion of the \gls{hv} and charge readout studies is the development of a new fully modular and pixelated \lartpc{} concept---\AC{}.
Splitting the detector volume into independent self-contained \glspl{tpc}s sharing a common \lar{} bath reduces the required drift voltages to a manageable level and minimises inactive material.
A pixelated charge readout paired with new electronics will exploit true \gls{3d} tracking, thereby reducing event pile-up and improving background rejection, as will be shown.
Results of the pixel feasibility study were used to simulate the impact of pile-up for \AC{} in the \dune{} \gls{nd}.
The influence of \Pgpz-induced \gls{em} showers has on neutrino energy reconstruction was investigated.
Misidentified neutrino energy in \AC{} is conservative below \SI{0.1}{\percent} for more than \SI{50}{\percent} of the neutrino events, well within the \dune{} error budget.
The work described in this thesis has made \AC{} the top candidate for the \lar{} component in the \dune{} \gls{nd} complex.
