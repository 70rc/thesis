I want to thank my supervisor \textbf{Antonio Ereditato} for making this thesis possible.
In particular, you supported my decision to write a hardware thesis, which would not have been possible at many other institutions.

I would like to express my gratitude to my examiners \textbf{Hucheng Chen} and \textbf{Peter Wurz}.

Some of my biggest appreciations go towards \textbf{Igor Kreslo} who taught me most of my detector physics knowledge and (almost) always had an answer to my questions.
It was always enlightening and great pleasure discussing with you and being challenged by you.

I also want to thank \textbf{Michele Weber} for the many times he provided me with a simple solution to a seemingly complex problem, be it physical or organisational.

I am really grateful to \textbf{James Sinclair} for his guidance, in particular towards the end of my thesis.
More than once, you prevented me from despairing or accidentally killing myself in the lab.
Surprisingly, you never got tired of reading my thesis and fixing my abominations of the English language.

Without the input of \textbf{Yun-Tse Tsai} and \textbf{Tracy Usher} from SLAC I would not have succeeded at reconstructing the pixel data. Thank you!

A very big thank you to \textbf{Dean Shooltz} from \lariat{} for providing the documentation of the differential warm signal path of \lariat{}.
This allowed me to tame our noise-haunted setup.

I am grateful to \textbf{Hucheng Chen}, \textbf{Gianluigi De Geronimo}, \textbf{Neena Nambiar}, \textbf{Emerson Vernon}, \textbf{Jack Fried}, \textbf{Shanshan Gao}, and \textbf{Linda Feierabend} for the great time I had at \gls{bnl} and everything they taught me about electronics.
I really enjoyed the company of \textbf{Aseem Gupta}, \textbf{Stefania Stucci}, and \textbf{Hannah Herde}.

I want to thank \textbf{Kam-Biu Luk} and the neutrino group at \gls{lbnl} for hosting me.
In particular, I am grateful to \textbf{Daniel Dwyer} for telling me everything about \larpix{}, and \textbf{Chris Marshall} for his guidance on the \gls{nd} pile-up study.

None of this would have been possible without the excellent support of \textbf{Camilla Tognina} and \textbf{Pascal Lutz} from the \gls{help} electronics workshop, and \textbf{Roger Hänni}, \textbf{Jan Christen}, \textbf{Lorenzo Meier}, \textbf{Gregor Pfäffli}, and \textbf{Roger Liechti} from the \gls{help} mechanical workshop. Thank you!

I am really thankful to all the friends I have made at \gls{help} for the magnificent time: \textbf{Martin Auger}, \textbf{Matthias Lüthi}, \textbf{Christoph Urs Benjamin Rudolf von Rohr}, \textbf{James Sinclair}, \textbf{David \gls{lorca}}, \textbf{Camilla Tognina}, \textbf{Sabina Joos}, \textbf{Francesca Stocker}, \textbf{Yifan Chen}, \textbf{Sébastien Delaquis}, \textbf{Martti Nirkko}, \textbf{Lukas Bütikofer}, \textbf{Daniel Coderre}, \textbf{Marcel Häberli}, and \textbf{Martin Hierholzer}.
Working (and having fun) with you never became boring.

Furthermore, I am grateful to \textbf{Ursula Witschi}, \textbf{Marcella Esposito}, and \textbf{Irene Neeser} from the \gls{help} secretariat for their patience with my inferior organisation.

I also appreciate the computing support from \textbf{Jeremy Singh}, \textbf{Gianfranco Sciacca}, and \textbf{Luis Martinez}.

My warmest thanks go towards all my friends for their continued support, even though I neglected them more than once during the last four years.

I am most grateful to my flatmate \textbf{Annette Mettler} and her husband \textbf{Raphaël Guillet} for bearing with me for the last years.
You have become like family to me.

Most of all I want to thank my parents, \textbf{Brigitte} and \textbf{Willi Göldi}, and my brother, \textbf{Sebastian Göldi}, for their (moral and financial) support.
You taught me the most important lesson in science (and maybe also life): Always stay curious and question everything.
