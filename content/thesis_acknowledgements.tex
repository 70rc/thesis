I want to thank my supervisor \textbf{Antonio Ereditato} for making this thesis possible.
In particular, you supported my decision to write a pure hardware thesis, which would not have been possible at many other institutions.

I would like to express my gratitude to my examiners \textbf{Hucheng Chen} and \textbf{Peter Wurz}.

Some of my biggest appreciations go towards \textbf{Igor Kreslo} who taught me most of my detector physics knowledge and (almost) always had an answer to my questions.
It was always enlightening and great pleasure discussing with you and being challenged by you.

I also want to thank \textbf{Michele Weber} for the many times he provided me with a simple solution to a seemingly complex problem, be it physical or organisational.

I am really grateful to \textbf{James Sinclair} for his guidance, in particular towards the end of my thesis.
More than once, you prevented me from despairing or accidentally killing myself in the lab.
Surprisingly, you never got tired of reading my thesis and fixing my abominations of the English language.

Without the input of \textbf{Yun-Tse Tsai} and \textbf{Tracy Usher} from SLAC I would not have succeeded at reconstructing the pixel data.

A very big thank you to \textbf{Dean Shooltz} from \lariat{} for providing the documentation of the differential warm signal path of \lariat{}.
This allowed me to tame our noise-haunted setup.
