The \AC{} concept, described in Section~\ref{sec:ac_argoncube}, enables a \lartpc{} component in the \dune{} \gls{nd} complex.
This chapter will present a more detailed design for the \gls{nd}, together with a feasibility study of a \lartpc{} at the expected rates.


\section{\AC{} in the \glsentryshort{dune} \glsentrylong{nd}}
\label{sec:dune-nd_ac}

While Section~\ref{sec:ac_argoncube} gave a general overview of the \AC{} concept, this section focuses on the detailed implementation for the \dune{} \gls{nd}.
After the establishment of the key technologies described in this work, the next step will be a \num{2 x 2} module prototype at \gls{help}.
Finally, the current status of an \AC{} \lartpc{} component for the \dune{} \gls{nd} complex is given.

The goals of this prototype are testing the mechanical design and cryogenic systems, comparing different charge and light readout systems, and studying module insertion and extraction procedures with a focus on their influence on purity.
For comparison, one of the four modules will be equipped with a classic wire readout.
To investigate purity, first tests will be performed with the \AC{} demonstrator \gls{tpc} described in Section~\ref{sec:ac_viper}.
The \gls{tpc} will be mounted inside an otherwise empty module, hanging from an intermediate support layer.
This will also serve as a first cryogenic stress-test of the module structure and \lar{} purification.

The four modules will be housed in an existing cylindrical, vacuum-insulated cryostat at \gls{help}.
With its approximately \SI{2}{\metre} diameter by \SI{2}{\metre} height it provides a \lar{} bath volume of roughly \SI{6}{\metre\cubed}.
To fit inside the bath, the modules are scaled down to a footprint of \SI{0.67 x 0.67}{\metre} and a height of \SI{1.81}{\metre}.
Instead of service volumes, cooling is provided by two liquid nitrogen turbo-cooling circuits attached to the inner cryostat wall inside the insulation vacuum.
They cool the \lar{} bath via evaporation of the liquid nitrogen.
The nitrogen flow has to be regulated precisely to keep the \lar{} stable and prevent it from boiling or freezing.

The height of the actual \gls{tpc} in a fully equipped module is \SI{1235}{\milli\metre}.
Due to the split-\gls{tpc} design, the resulting cathode voltage required for a \SI{1}{\kilo\volt\per\centi\metre} field is below \SI{35}{\kilo\volt}.
On the bottom, \SI{160}{\milli\metre} are occupied by the heat exchanger and check valves for \lar{} exchange with the bath upon insertion and extraction.
The remaining room on top of the \gls{tpc} is filled up by the \gls{hv} feedthrough, a buffer gas phase, and a potential recirculation pump.
All support structures except for the flanges at the module top and bottom are made from \emph{Amsler \& Frey HGW 2372} G10~\cite{g10}, including most of the screws.
The thickness of the side walls is \SI{10}{\milli\metre} while the flanges are made of \SI{20}{\milli\metre} stainless steel plates.
An engineering drawing of a \num{2 x 2} prototype module is given in Figure~\ref{fig:ac_module}.
It uses a \lar{} pump donated by \gls{fail} in combination with oxygen traps mounted on top of the module.

Figure~\ref{fig:2x2_dim} gives the detailed dimensions of a prototype module.
It depicts the first module that will be equipped with the demonstrator \gls{tpc}.
For this test, an internal pump salvaged from \AT{} will be used.
An engineering drawing together with a picture of the pixel demonstrator module is given in Figure~\ref{fig:2x2_mod}.

Table~\ref{tab:dune-nd_dim} gives an overview of the most important dimensions of the \num{2 x 2} \gls{help} prototype and the preliminary \gls{nd} design (see Section~\ref{sec:dune-nd_ac_nd}).
In particular the table contains a rough estimate of dead space, caused by the modular design, and the corresponding active volume fraction.
For these calculations, a total charge readout thickness of \SI{20}{\milli\metre} and a total light readout thickness of \SI{5}{\milli\metre} were assumed.
The difference is caused by the fact that charge readout electronics are located directly behind the readout while the \glspl{sipm} are only mounted on the edges of the \AL{} modules.
Additionally, a few \si{\milli\metre} clearance between the anode plane and the module wall are required for convection cooling of the \larpix{} electronics.
Readout thicknesses also include the clearance required between adjacent modules ($\sim{\SI{1}{\milli\metre}}$).
The resulting total fraction of active volume is \SI{87.0}{\percent} for the \num{2 x 2} prototype.

In a first phase, the \num{2 x 2} prototype will be operated in the Grosslabor of \gls{help}, taking cosmic ray data.
After a successful test of all subsystems, it is planned to be installed in a charged particle test beam at either CERN or \gls{fail} to investigate the influence of the module walls on calorimetry and tracking.

The \AC{} \gls{nd} design is based on a scaled-up version of the \num{2 x 2} module design described above.
Modules will have a footprint of \SI{1 x 1}{\metre} and a height of \SI{3.5}{\metre}.
Again, \SI{0.1}{\metre} at the bottom are occupied by the heat exchanger and valves while \SI{0.4}{\metre} at the top are taken up by feedthroughs and the gas phase.
This results in a \gls{tpc} size of \SI{1 x 1 x 3}{\metre}, split into two halves by the cathode.
The full detector will consist of \num{4 x 5} modules with the longer dimension in beam direction.
These dimensions were optimised for maximum hadron containment by means of simulations done by the neutrino group at \gls{lbnl}~\cite{lartpcSizeChris}.
While horizontal dimensions are unproblematic, the vertical \SI{3}{\metre} are at the lower limit.
According to the simulations, \SI{2.5}{\metre} would be sufficient but provide no safety margin at all.
Reducing the height by \SI{0.25}{\metre} results in a significant loss of hadron containment already.
Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_lartpc-size} illustrates this by means of the cross-section coverage as a function of neutrino energy.
Cross-section coverage is similar to containment efficiency but should not be confused with the latter.
To assess the efficiency, a detector of the corresponding size in the neutrino beam is simulated.
While this indeed provides a good measure of the efficiency of the detector to contain different events, it is not necessarily a good quantity to assess the required detector size.
Many events are simply not contained because of their specific location and/or orientation inside the detector.
Cross-section coverage remedies this deficiency by looking at the actual extent of the event instead of its containment at a random position inside a realistic detector.
On the other hand, an event extending through the full detector will very likely never be contained in a real detector due to the low probability of exactly happening in the right location.
Therefore, the maximum event size needs to be selected smaller than the full detector size.
For the \gls{nd} simulation, this was chosen as \SI{0.5}{\metre} on all edges.
Like this, cross-section coverage allows to probe for phase space regions inaccessible to a particular detector configuration.
In Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_lartpc-size}, it can be seen that cross-section coverage decreases rapidly for detector heights below \SI{2.5}{\metre}.
A height of \SI{3}{\metre} is therefore preferable to have some buffer for yet unknown uncertainties in the simulation.

A pixel pitch of \SI{3}{\milli\metre} was chosen.
This value has been field-tested in a physics experiment, \uboone{}~\cite{uboone}, and is below the $\approx \SI{5}{\milli\metre}$ wire pitch of the \dune{} \glspl{fd}~\cite{dune4}.
The \larpix{} electronics described in Section~\ref{sec:studies_electronics_pixel} are designed to be capable of handling the data rates and power consumption expected for a \SI{3}{\milli\metre} pixel pitch \AC{} \gls{nd} component.
Therefore, a sufficient spatial resolution from a physics point of view is provided while keeping the power and data rate demands on the readout electronics under control.

Inspired by the design of the \dune{} \SI{35}{\tonne} prototype at \gls{fail}~\cite{dune4}, the \lar{} bath is held in a foam-insulated membrane cryostat.
The outer support structure is a \SI{0.3}{\metre} thick steel-reinforced concrete layer, followed by a \SI{0.4}{\metre} thick polyurethane foam layer for thermal insulation.
Inside of this is a \SI{2}{\milli\metre} thick stainless steel membrane sealing the \lar{} bath from the environment.
There are several other support layers, all of which with a thickness of $\sim{\SI{1}{\milli\metre}}$, with a more detailed description in~\cite{dune4}.
The total thickness of the cryostat wall amounts to \num{2.88} radiation lengths.
Cooling is provided by \num{10} uninstrumented \SI{0.5 x 1}{\metre} service modules equipped with cryocoolers arranged on the two detector faces parallel to beam direction.
The total required cryostat footprint is therefore \SI{5 x 5}{\metre}.

Table~\ref{tab:dune-nd_dim} gives an overview of the most important \AC{} \gls{nd} dimensions, in comparison to the \num{2 x 2} \gls{help} prototype.
Due to the bigger modules, the total fraction of active volume is increased to \SI{91.2}{\percent}.
Drift direction is perpendicular to beam direction.
The reason for this is to reduce the rate on single pixels.
If drift direction is parallel to beam direction, particle tracks highly parallel to drift direction lead to a very high rate on single channels potentially leading to a buffer overflow and thus data loss in the \larpix{} chip.
In addition, power dissipation increases proportionally to the event rate due to the smart zero suppression scheme of \larpix{}.
Another advantage is that dead space in beam direction between adjacent modules will only be \SI{30}{\milli\metre} due to the very slim dimensions of \AL{}.
Figure~\ref{fig:dune-nd_ac} shows an artistic view of the \AC{} \gls{nd} component.
