Chapter~\ref{chap:nu-detection} will give an overview of the history of neutrino detectors, describe the current state of the field and then introduce the most relevant physics.
Giunti and Kim provide a more detailed history of neutrino physics~\cite{giunti}.

The work in Chapter~\ref{chap:dune-nd} was a collaboration with the neutrino group at \gls{lbnl}.
In particular, they provided the simulation tool, Argon Box, as well as the raw simulation data.
The \Pgpz pile-up study was done by the author with advice from C.\ Marshall from \gls{lbnl}.
