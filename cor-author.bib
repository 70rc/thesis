  abstract={Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are ideally suited to perform long-baseline neutrino experiments aiming to measure CP violation in the lepton sector, and determine the ordering of the three neutrino mass eigenstates.
    LArTPCs have used projective wire readouts for charge detection since their conception in 1977.
    However, wire readouts are notoriously fragile and therefore a limiting factor in the design of any large mass detectors.
    Furthermore, a wire readout also introduces intrinsic ambiguities in event reconstruction.
    Within the ArgonCube concept—the liquid argon component of the DUNE near detector—we are developing a pixelated charge readout for LArTPCs.
    Pixelated charge readout systems represent the single largest advancement in the sensitivity of LArTPCs.
    They are mechanically robust and provide direct 3D readout, serving to minimise reconstruction ambiguities, enabling more advanced triggers, further reducing event pile-up and improving background rejection.
    This article presents first results from a pixelated LArTPC prototype built and operated in Bern.}

  abstract={We present a study on the dependence of electric breakdown discharge properties on electrode geometry and the breakdown field in liquid argon near its boiling point.
    The measurements were performed with a spherical cathode and a planar anode at distances ranging from 0.1 mm to 10.0 mm.
    A detailed study of the time evolution of the breakdown volt-ampere characteristics was performed for the first time.
    It revealed a slow streamer development phase in the discharge.
    The results of a spectroscopic study of the visible light emission of the breakdowns complement the measurements.
    The light emission from the initial phase of the discharge is attributed to electro-luminescence of liquid argon following a current of drifting electrons.
    These results contribute to set benchmarks for breakdown-safe design of ionization detectors, such as Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr TPC).}
