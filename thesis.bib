	abstract={In this paper we present results on measurements of the dielectric strength of liquid argon near its boiling point and cathode-anode distances in the range of 0.1 mm to 40 mm with spherical cathode and plane anode. We show that at such distances the applied electric field at which breakdowns occur is as low as 40 kV/cm. Flash-overs across the ribbed dielectric of the high voltage feed-through are observed for a length of 300 mm starting from a voltage of 55 kV. These results contribute to set reference for the breakdown-free design of ionization detectors, such as Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr TPC).}

	abstract={The proliferation of liquid argon time projection chamber detectors makes the characterization of the dielectric properties of liquid argon a critical task. To improve understanding of these properties, a systematic study of the breakdown electric field in liquid argon was conducted using a dedicated cryostat connected to the MicroBooNE cryogenic system at Fermilab. An electrode sphere-plate geometry was implemented using spheres with diameters of 1.3 mm, 5.0 mm, and 76 mm. The MicroBooNE cryogenic system allowed measurements to be taken at a variety of electronegative contamination levels ranging from a few parts-per-million to tens of parts-per-trillion. The cathode-anode distance was varied from 0.1 mm to 2.5 cm. The results demonstrate a geometric dependence of the electric field strength at breakdown. This study is the first time that the dependence of the breakdown field on stressed cathode area has been shown for liquid argon.}

	abstract={A methodology to measure Near Infrared (NIR) scintillations in gaseous and liquid Ar, using Geiger-mode APDs (GAPDs) sensitive in the NIR and pulsed X-ray irradiation, is described. This study has been triggered by the development of Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) with optical readout in the NIR using combined THGEM/GAPD multiplier, which may come to be in demand in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. A new approach to measure the NIR scintillation yield at cryogenic temperatures has been developed, namely using GAPDs in single photoelectron counting mode with time resolution. The time structure of NIR scintillations and their light yield were measured both for primary scintillations and that of secondary at moderate electric fields (electroluminescence), in gaseous and liquid Ar.}

	abstract={We present here a comprehensive study of the light yield of primary and secondary scintillations produced in gaseous and liquid Ar in the near infrared (NIR) and visible region, at cryogenic temperatures. The measurements were performed using Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (GAPDs) and pulsed X-ray irradiation. The primary scintillation yield of the fast emission component in gaseous Ar was found to be independent of temperature in the range of 87–160 K; it amounted to 17000±3000 photon/MeV in the NIR in the range of 690–1000 nm. In liquid Ar at 87 K, the primary scintillation yield of the fast component was considerably reduced, amounting to 510±90 photon/MeV, in the range of 400–1000 nm. Proportional NIR scintillations (electroluminescence) in gaseous Ar were also observed; their amplification parameter at 160 K was measured to be 13 photons per drifting electron per kV. No proportional scintillations were observed in liquid Ar up to the electric fields of 30 kV/cm. The applications of NIR scintillations in dark matter search and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments and in ion beam radiotherapy are considered.}

	abstract={Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) are referred to as a new class of noble-gas detectors operated at cryogenic temperatures with electron avalanching performed directly in the detection medium, the latter being in gaseous, liquid or two-phase (liquid-gas) state. Electron avalanching is provided by Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) multipliers, in particular GEMs and THGEMs, operated at cryogenic temperatures in dense noble gases. The final goal for this kind of detectors is the development of large-volume detectors of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event experiments and medical applications, such as coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, direct dark matter search, astrophysical (solar and supernova) neutrino detection experiments and Positron Emission Tomography technique. This review is the first attempt to summarize the results on CRAD performances obtained by different groups. A brief overview of the available CRAD concepts is also given and the most remarkable CRAD physics effects are discussed.}

Due to radiation trapping of resonance levels, many of the cross sections depend on the target pressure. Detailed pressure dependence for over 50 levels is also provided.

The emission is dominated by the analogue of the so-called 2nd excimer continuum. Various additional emission features were found. The time structure of the light emission has been measured for a set of well-defined wavelength positions. The results help to interpret literature data in the context of liquid rare-gas detectors in which the wavelength information is lost due to the use of wavelength shifters.}

	abstract={We describe a novel high-speed front-end electronic board (FEB) for interfacing an array of 32 Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPM) with a computer. The FEB provides individually adjustable bias for the SiPMs, and performs low-noise analog signal amplification, conditioning and digitization. It provides event timing information accurate to 1.3 ns RMS. The signal-to-noise ratio of 12 is attained for the first photo-electron peak. The back-end data interface is realized on the basis of 100 Mbps Ethernet. The design allows daisy-chaining of up to 256 units into one network interface, thus enabling compact and efficient readout schemes for multi-channel scintillating detectors, using SiPMs as photo-sensors.}

	abstract={The use of efficient wavelength-shifters from the vacuum-ultraviolet to the photo-sensor's range of sensitivity is a key feature in detectors for Dark Matter search and neutrino physics based on liquid argon scintillation detection. Thin film of Tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) deposited onto the surface delimiting the active volume of the detector and/or onto the photosensor optical window is the most common solution in current and planned experiments. Detector design and response can be evaluated and correctly simulated only when the properties of the optical system in use (TPB film + substrate) are fully understood. Characterization of the optical system requires specific, sometimes sophisticated optical methodologies. In this paper the main features of TPB coatings on different, commonly used substrates is reported, as a result of two independent campaigns of measurements at the specialized optical metrology labs of ENEA and University of Tor Vergata. Measured features include TPB emission spectra with lineshape and relative intensity variation recorded as a function of the film thickness and for the first time down to LAr temperature, as well as optical reflectance and transmittance spectra of the TPB coated substrates in the wavelength range of the TPB emission.}
