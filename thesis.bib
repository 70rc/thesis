  Abstract                 = {The development and operation of liquid-argon time-projection chambers for neutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition in order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology. Whereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded events, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic solution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid the design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes the use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which individual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology. Many tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and, together, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper describes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools used to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE detector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are presented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state event topologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The proliferation of liquid argon time projection chamber detectors makes the characterization of the dielectric properties of liquid argon a critical task. To improve understanding of these properties, a systematic study of the breakdown electric field in liquid argon was conducted using a dedicated cryostat connected to the MicroBooNE cryogenic system at Fermilab. An electrode sphere-plate geometry was implemented using spheres with diameters of 1.3 mm, 5.0 mm, and 76 mm. The MicroBooNE cryogenic system allowed measurements to be taken at a variety of electronegative contamination levels ranging from a few parts-per-million to tens of parts-per-trillion. The cathode-anode distance was varied from 0.1 mm to 2.5 cm. The results demonstrate a geometric dependence of the electric field strength at breakdown. This study is the first time that the dependence of the breakdown field on stressed cathode area has been shown for liquid argon.},

  Abstract                 = {The ArgoNeuT liquid argon time projection chamber has collected thousands of neutrino and anti-neutrino events during an extended run period in the NuMI beam-line at Fermilab. This paper focuses on the main aspects of the detector layout and related technical features, including the cryogenic equipment, time projection chamber, read-out electronics, and off-line data treatment. The detector commissioning phase, physics run, and first neutrino event displays are also reported. The characterization of the main working parameters of the detector during data-taking, the ionization electron drift velocity and lifetime in liquid argon, as obtained from through-going muon data complete the present report.},

  Abstract                 = {ArgonCube Light readout system (ArCLight) is a novel device for detecting scintillation light over large areas with Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) of the order of a few percent. Its robust technological design allows for efficient use in large-volume particle detectors, such as Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) or liquid scintillator detectors. Due to its dielectric structure it can be placed inside volumes with high electric field. It could potentially replace vacuum PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMTs) in applications where high PDE is not required. The photon detection efficiency for a 10 × 10 cm2 detector prototype was measured to be in the range of 0.8 percent to 2.2 percent across the active area.},

Given the relatively shallow depth of the detectors, the continuous flux of cosmic ray particles crossing their volumes introduces a constant background which can be falsely identified as part of the event of interest. Here we present the Cosmic Ray Tagger (CRT) system, a novel technique to tag and identify these crossing particles using scintillation modules which measure their time and coordinates relative to the internal events to the neutrino detector, with the intent of mitigating their effect in the event tracking reconstruction.},

It provides event timing information accurate to 1.3 ns RMS. The signal-to-noise ratio of 12 is attained for the first photo-electron peak. The back-end data interface is realized on the basis of 100 Mbps Ethernet. The design allows daisy-chaining of up to 256 units into one network interface, thus enabling compact and efficient readout schemes for multi-channel scintillating detectors, using SiPMs as photo-sensors.},

The primary scintillation yield of the fast emission component in gaseous Ar was found to be independent of temperature in the range of 87–160 K; it amounted to 17000±3000 photon/MeV in the NIR in the range of 690–1000 nm. In liquid Ar at 87 K, the primary scintillation yield of the fast component was considerably reduced, amounting to 510±90 photon/MeV, in the range of 400–1000 nm. Proportional NIR scintillations (electroluminescence) in gaseous Ar were also observed; their amplification parameter at 160 K was measured to be 13 photons per drifting electron per kV. No proportional scintillations were observed in liquid Ar up to the electric fields of 30 kV/cm.

  Abstract                 = {We review the current status of liquid noble gas radiation detectors with energy threshold in the keV range, which are of interest for direct dark matter searches, measurement of coherent neutrino scattering and other low energy particle physics experiments. Emphasis is given to the operation principles and the most important instrumentation aspects of these detectors, principally of those operated in the double-phase mode. Recent technological advances and relevant developments in photon detection and charge readout are discussed in the context of their applicability to those experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The Homestake Solar Neutrino Detector, based on the inverse beta-decay reaction ν e + 37 Cl → 37 Ar + e - , has been measuring the flux of solar neutrinos since 1970. The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37 Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37 Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37 Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of efficient wavelength-shifters from the vacuum-ultraviolet to the photo-sensor's range of sensitivity is a key feature in detectors for Dark Matter search and neutrino physics based on liquid argon scintillation detection. Thin film of Tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) deposited onto the surface delimiting the active volume of the detector and/or onto the photosensor optical window is the most common solution in current and planned experiments. Detector design and response can be evaluated and correctly simulated only when the properties of the optical system in use (TPB film + substrate) are fully understood. Characterization of the optical system requires specific, sometimes sophisticated optical methodologies. In this paper the main features of TPB coatings on different, commonly used substrates is reported, as a result of two independent campaigns of measurements at the specialized optical metrology labs of ENEA and University of Tor Vergata. Measured features include TPB emission spectra with lineshape and relative intensity variation recorded as a function of the film thickness and for the first time down to LAr temperature, as well as optical reflectance and transmittance spectra of the TPB coated substrates in the wavelength range of the TPB emission.},

Excitation was performed using continuous and pulsed 12 keV electron beams. The emission is dominated by the analogue of the so-called 2nd excimer continuum. Various additional emission features were found. The time structure of the light emission has been measured for a set of well-defined wavelength positions. The results help to interpret literature data in the context of liquid rare-gas detectors in which the wavelength information is lost due to the use of wavelength shifters.},

It describes some simple simulations which were performed in order to understand the attenuation behaviors of acrylic light-guides operated in air and argon, which were characterized in [2]. Whilst these simulations are only at the level of sophistication of a toy model, they illustrate interesting non-exponential light attenuation effects and the differences between operating light-guide based detectors in argon and air environments. We investigate the effects of surface absorption, surface roughness and wavelength dependence, and use a model tuned on the light-guide attenuation curve measured in air to make a prediction of the light-guide attenuation curve in argon. This curve is compared with data from a liquid argon test stand, and an improvement over a simple exponential model is observed.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a totally innovative device for the detection of liquid argon scintillation light, that has been named ARAPUCA (Argon R&D Advanced Program at UniCAmp). It is composed of a passive light collector and of active devices. The latters are standard SiPMs that operate at liquid argon temperature, while the passive collector is based on a new technology, never explored in this field before. It is a photon trap, that allows to collect light with extremely high efficiency. The total detection efficiency of the device can be tuned by modifying the ratio between the area of the active devices (SiPM) and the area of the optical window. For example, it will allow to reach a detection efficiency at the level of one percent on a surface of 50 × 50 cm 2 with an active coverage of 2 × 2 cm 2 (two/three large area SiPM). It is also a cheap device, since the major part of its cost is represented by the active devices. For these reason this appears to be the ideal device for scintillation light detection in large Time Projection Chambers. With appropriate modifications it can be used also in next generation Dark Matter detectors.},

  Abstract                 = {Scintillation light produced in liquid argon (LAr) must be shifted from 128 nm to visible wavelengths in light detection systems used for liquid argon time-projection chambers (LArTPCs). To date, LArTPC light collection systems have employed tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) coatings on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) or plates placed in front of the PMTs. Recently, a new approach using TPB-coated light guides was proposed. In this paper, we report on light guides with improved attenuation lengths above 100 cm when measured in air. This is an important step in the development of meter-scale light guides for future LArTPCs. Improvements come from using a new acrylic-based coating, diamond-polished cast UV transmitting acrylic bars, and a hand-dipping technique to coat the bars. We discuss a model for connecting bar response in air to response in liquid argon and compare this to data taken in liquid argon. The good agreement between the prediction of the model and the measured response in liquid argon demonstrates that characterization in air is sufficient for quality control of bar production. This model can be used in simulations of light guides for future experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including those on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group ( http://pdg.lbl.gov [http://pdg.lbl.gov] ). The printed PDG Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings. A Booklet with the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the review articles is also available. ----- -- Contents ----- -- ----- -- Abstract, Contributors, Highlights and Table of Contents -- Acrobat PDF (150 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0001-0010.pdf] ----- -- ----- -- Introduction -- Acrobat PDF (456 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0011-0026.pdf] ----- -- ----- -- Particle Physics Summary Tables ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (155 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0029-0031.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (134 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0032-0035.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (84 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0036.pdf] ----- -- Mesons -- Acrobat PDF (871 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0037-0086.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (300 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0087-0102.pdf] ----- -- Searches (Supersymmetry, Compositeness, etc.) -- Acrobat PDF (91 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0103-0104.pdf] ----- -- Tests of conservation laws -- Acrobat PDF (330 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0105-0116.pdf] ----- -- ----- -- Reviews, Tables, and Plots ----- -- Detailed contents for this section -- Acrobat PDF (37 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0117-0118.pdf] ----- -- Constants, Units, Atomic and Nuclear Properties -- Acrobat PDF (278 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0119-0131.pdf] ----- -- Standard Model and Related Topics -- Acrobat PDF (7.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0132-0348.pdf] ----- -- Astrophysics and Cosmology -- Acrobat PDF (2.7 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0349-0428.pdf] ----- -- Experimental Methods and Colliders -- Acrobat PDF (3.8 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0429-0516.pdf] ----- -- Mathematical Tools or Statistics, Monte Carlo, GroupTheory -- Acrobat PDF (1.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0517-0559.pdf] ----- -- Kinematics, Cross-Section Formulae, and Plots -- Acrobat PDF (3.9 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0560-0598.pdf] ----- -- ----- -- Particle Listings ----- -- Illustrative key and abbreviations -- Acrobat PDF (235 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0601-0610.pdf] ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0613-0710.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (1.5 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0711-0790.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (1.2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0791-0846.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Light unflavored and strange -- Acrobat PDF (4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0847-1043.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Charmed and bottom -- Acrobat PDF (7.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1044-1363.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Other -- Acrobat PDF (3.1 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1364-1500.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (3.97 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1501-1672.pdf] ----- -- Miscellaneous searches -- Acrobat PDF (2.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1673-1790.pdf] ----- -- ----- -- Index -- Acrobat PDF (160 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1791-1808.pdf] -----},

  Abstract                 = {The electric strength of liquefied argon is found to depend to a marked degree on the nature of both cathode and anode. This effect has been investigated systematically. The cathode is thought to influence the strength through the process of electron emission into the liquid, whilst the anode becomes important only if the rate of emission from the cathode exceeds that at which the anode can accept charge. In this case a high space charge field is set up near the anode which can lower the applied field necessary for breakdown. By measuring the electric strength of liquid argon containing various concentrations of oxygen, it has been shown that probably the anode space charge is formed only when part of the current before breakdown is carried by negative oxygen ions. The electric strength is found to be very sensitive to small concentrations of oxygen.},

  Abstract                 = {The strengths of liquified argon, oxygen and nitrogen are of the order of 1 mv/cm but are found to depend to a marked degree on the nature of the electrode surfaces. The strength can be changed in a regular manner (sometimes by as much as 50\%) by changing both the electrode metal and the degree of surface oxidation. The important discovery is that the anode as well as the cathode has a strong influence on the strength. This surprising result has, as yet, no obvious explanation in terms of usual breakdown mechanisms but may be very significant, not only for theories of breakdown in these liquids but for hydrocarbon liquids as well.},

  Abstract                 = {The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be a premier facility for exploring long-standing questions about the boundaries of the standard model. Acting in concert with the liquid argon time projection chambers underpinning the far detector design, the DUNE photon detection system will capture ultraviolet scintillation light in order to provide valuable timing information for event reconstruction. To maximize the active area while maintaining a small photocathode coverage, the experiment will utilize a design based on plastic light guides coated with a wavelength-shifting compound, along with silicon photomultipliers, to collect and record scintillation light from liquid argon. This report presents recent preliminary performance measurements of this baseline design and several alternative designs which promise significant improvements in sensitivity to low-energy interactions.},

A prediction for proton ionization signals is made by means of interpolation.
